# Blackboard Downloader

This program was developed for my final project for the Higher Diploma in Computing degree at the Dublin Institute of Technology. It is written in C# and uses Windows Forms for the GUI. 

Blackboard Downloader was written to simplify downloading large amounts of files from courses on Blackboard. Normally, downloading an entire course's files requires individually clicking on each file, finding the download link, saving it, and then manually re-organizing them into appropriate folders. This can take quite a while when some courses have over 100 files.

Blackboard Downloader does all the work for you. After entering your login, Blackboard Downloader will search for all the content available to you on Blackboard and then display it in an easy to navigate list. An entire course's content can be downloaded in the click of a button, and all files are automatically organized into folders. Individual files or folders can also be selected for download.

Currently, Blackboard Downloader only works with DIT's implementation of Blackboard, called Webcourses. But the program is designed to be easily adaptable to other Blackboard implementations, and in the future there will be options available to the user to configure this.
